# Talkora Backend

The real backend engine for Talkora — a full-stack English-learning platform for school
students in Classes 4–10. This is a **separate service** from the existing Next.js frontend
(built by v0). It does not modify, redesign, or replace the frontend in any way.

Node.js · Express · TypeScript · MongoDB Atlas (Mongoose) · Zod · JWT

## 1. What this is (and isn't)

- Real MongoDB persistence. No in-memory database, no mock data as production storage.
- Real authentication (school / teacher / student), with JWT-based sessions.
- Server-owned business rules: scoring, level unlocking, achievements, and XP are all computed
  and enforced on the backend — the frontend never dictates a score or unlock state.
- A curriculum **engine**, not hardcoded lessons: Classes → Levels → Lessons → Activities are
  all database-driven. Only Class 4 / Level 1 ("Word Explorer") is fully authored with 10 real
  activities, per the current product scope; the rest of the structure (Classes 4–10, 10 levels
  each) is seeded and ready for further authoring.
- Provider abstractions for AI (Miss Julie), voice synthesis, speech recognition, and
  pronunciation scoring — so real vendors can be swapped in later without touching business logic.
  Until real credentials are configured, voice/speech/pronunciation providers return
  `available: false` rather than fake results.

## 2. Getting started

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/talkora?retryWrites=true&w=majority
JWT_SECRET=<a long random string>
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000   # your Next.js frontend origin

AI_PROVIDER=groq          # groq | openai | mock
GROQ_API_KEY=...          # required if AI_PROVIDER=groq
OPENAI_API_KEY=...        # required if AI_PROVIDER=openai
```

MongoDB Atlas is required (not a local standalone `mongod`) because `ProgressService` relies
on multi-document consistency patterns designed for a replica set, which Atlas clusters are by
default. A free M0 Atlas cluster is sufficient for development.

Seed the database (demo school, teacher, 8 students, Classes 4–10 with 10 levels each, and
fully-authored Class 4 / Level 1 activities):

```bash
npm run seed
```

The seed script prints demo credentials to the console. **Do not use these in production** —
they exist purely so you can immediately log in and test the whole flow:

```
School code:      DEMO001
School password:  talkora123
Teacher email:    teacher@demo.talkora.dev
Teacher password: teacher123
Student codes:    printed per-student, regenerated every reseed
```

Run the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev        # ts-node/tsx with watch, http://localhost:5000
npm run build       # compile to dist/
npm start           # run compiled output
npm test            # jest — see note below on integration tests
```

## 3. Tests

`npm test` runs both unit tests (no database needed — password hashing, JWT, validation,
error shaping) and integration tests (real Express app + an in-memory MongoDB instance via
`mongodb-memory-server`, covering auth, student data isolation, locked-level enforcement, and
idempotent achievement unlocking).

**Note:** `mongodb-memory-server` downloads a MongoDB binary on first run
(`https://fastdl.mongodb.org`). This requires outbound internet access. In network-restricted
environments (e.g. a sandboxed CI runner with an egress allowlist), only the unit tests will
run; the integration tests will fail with a download error, not a code error. Run them on a
normal developer machine or a CI runner with open network access, or point
`mongodb-memory-server` at an already-installed local MongoDB binary
(see its `binary.systemBinary` option) if you need offline test runs.

## 4. Authentication flow

- **School**: `POST /api/auth/school/login` with `{ schoolCode, password }`.
- **Teacher**: `POST /api/auth/teacher/login` with `{ email, password }`.
- **Student** (two-step, matching the frontend's school-code → profile-select → code flow):
  1. `POST /api/auth/student/school` with `{ schoolCode }` → returns the list of active student
     profiles in that school (name, grade, avatar — no secrets).
  2. `POST /api/auth/student/login` with `{ schoolCode, studentId, studentCode }` → returns a JWT.
- All three return `{ token, ... }`. Send the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every
  subsequent request.
- `GET /api/auth/me` returns the current identity from the token (survives a page refresh as
  long as the frontend persists the token, e.g. in an httpOnly-adjacent storage strategy of your
  choice — this backend does not prescribe frontend storage).
- Identity is **always** derived from the verified token server-side. No endpoint trusts a
  client-supplied `studentId`/`schoolId` in the request body to determine whose data to touch.

## 5. Authorization model

Three roles: `SCHOOL_ADMIN`, `TEACHER`, `STUDENT`.

- `authenticate` — verifies the JWT, attaches `req.auth = { id, role, schoolId }`.
- `requireRole(...)` — restricts a route to specific roles.
- School/teacher routes over student records are scoped by `req.auth.schoolId` in every query
  (see `student.service.ts`), so a teacher from School A can never read or write School B's data
  — the record simply won't be found (404), not silently leaked.
- Student self-service routes (`/api/students/me`, `/api/progress/...`, `/api/ai/miss-julie`,
  `/api/voice/...`) always use `req.auth.id` as the student id. There is no route that accepts a
  student id in the body for a student-authenticated request.

## 6. Curriculum contract (frontend integration)

The frontend's current mock types (`services/types.ts`, `services/lessons.ts`) map onto this
backend as follows:

| Frontend mock type | Backend model / endpoint |
|---|---|
| `TalkoraClass` | `CurriculumClass` — `GET /api/classes` |
| `TalkoraLevel` (`place`, `number`, `status`) | `Level`, with per-student `status` (locked/unlocked/in-progress/completed) attached by `GET /api/classes/:classId/levels` when called with a student token |
| `TalkoraLesson` | `Lesson` — `GET /api/levels/:levelId/lessons` |
| `LessonActivity` (`type`, `prompt`, `target`, `choices`, `answer`, `hint`, `xp`) | `Activity` — `GET /api/lessons/:lessonId/activities`. **`answer` is stripped for student tokens** — the backend evaluates answers, not the client. |
| `LearningProgress` | `Progress` — `GET /api/progress/classes/:classId` |
| `Achievement` | `AchievementUnlock` joined with `Achievement` — `GET /api/achievements/mine` |
| `StudentMemory` | `GET /api/memory/mine` |
| `AIResponse` | `POST /api/ai/miss-julie` |
| `ActivityAttempt` | `POST /api/progress/activities/:activityId/attempts` |

The `lib/db/schema.ts` and `lib/auth.ts` (better-auth + Drizzle/Postgres) files present in the
uploaded frontend ZIP are leftover v0 scaffolding and are **not** used by this backend — this
backend is MongoDB + Mongoose + a custom JWT flow, per the architectural decision in the spec.
They can be removed from the frontend once it's wired to this API, or left inert.

## 8. Scoring, unlocking, and achievements — where the rules live

- **Scoring**: `ProgressService` (`computeScore` in `src/services/progress.service.ts`).
  Deterministic: correctness, attempt count, time-over-budget, and hints used all affect the
  0–100 score; XP awarded is `activity.xp * (score / 100)`, rounded. See `docs/architecture.md`
  for the exact formula and rationale.
- **Level unlocking**: also in `ProgressService`. Completing every lesson in a level unlocks the
  next level in `order`. `assertLevelAccessible` is called before *any* attempt is accepted, so
  a student cannot bypass the map by directly requesting a locked level's activity.
- **Achievements**: `AchievementService.evaluateForStudent` re-evaluates every achievement's
  `criteria` after each attempt and unlocks any that just crossed 100%. Achievements are defined
  as data (`Achievement.criteria`), not hardcoded per-achievement logic, so new ones can be added
  via the database without a code change (as long as their `criteria.type` is one already
  implemented in `computeProgressForCriteria`).
- **Idempotency**: `ActivityAttempt` has a unique `(studentId, idempotencyKey)` index. If the
  frontend retries a submission with the same key (e.g. after a flaky network response), the
  backend returns the original result instead of double-scoring or double-awarding XP.

## 9. Security notes

- Passwords (school, teacher, student code) are hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds), never stored or
  returned in plaintext after creation.
- `helmet`, `cors` (locked to `CLIENT_URL`), and tiered rate limiting (general / auth / AI /
  voice) are applied in `app.ts`.
- Zod validates every request body/params/query before it reaches a controller.
- Centralized error handler never leaks stack traces, secrets, or internal error messages to
  the client in production.
- `.env` is git-ignored; only `.env.example` (no real secrets) is committed.

## 10. What's intentionally not built yet

Per the spec's own scope guidance (`daily challenges` section): daily challenges have a clean
model/service/route (`DailyChallenge`, `DailyChallengeService`) but no admin authoring UI or
scheduler — that's for a later pass once the frontend needs it. Voice/speech/pronunciation
providers are real, swappable interfaces, but their only implementation today is `Mock*`, which
explicitly returns `available: false` — wiring a real vendor (ElevenLabs, OpenAI Realtime, etc.)
is a follow-up task once those API decisions are made, not a fake implementation to unblock the
frontend now.
